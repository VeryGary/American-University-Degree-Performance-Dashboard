# American-University-Degree-Performance-Dashboard

The American University Degree Performance Dashboard project is designed to provide a comprehensive data visualization solution using Power BI. The primary objective of this project is to offer an interactive tool for education policymakers, students, and researchers to analyze and compare outcomes for undergraduate degrees across U.S. universities. Key insights include salary percentiles, median earnings by major, school type comparisons, and regional trends.

## Objective
The main goals of this project are:

• Data Visualization: Develop dynamic visualizations for understanding degree outcomes and trends.
• Data Transformation: Use Power Query Editor to ensure consistent and accurate data.
• Data Modeling: Design a data model connecting information across schools, regions, and degree types.
• Key Metrics: Provide insights into salary percentiles, average salaries by school type, and major-specific outcomes.
• Interactive Visuals: Create visuals like bar charts, heatmaps, tables, and scatter plots.
• Drill-Down Capabilities: Enable drill-down and drill-through views for granular analysis.
• Filtering and Slicing: Add slicers for region, school type, major, and salary range.
• AI Integration: Incorporate AI-driven Q&A for instant insights based on user queries.

## Project Overview

• Data Source: Collected data from open university datasets and surveys.
• Data Transformations: Applied data cleaning and transformations such as merges, column reformatting, and standardization in Power Query Editor.
• Data Model: Created a star schema model to establish relationships between schools, regions, and degree data.
• Visualizations: Included visuals such as bar charts for salary by percentile, heatmaps for regional trends, and tables for school/major-specific insights.
• Custom Features: Added drill-through capabilities for school-specific analysis and AI-powered Q&A for deeper exploration.
• Functionality: Incorporated slicers for filtering by region, school type, degree, and salary range.

## Benefits

• Holistic Insights: Provides an interactive view of undergraduate degree performance across universities.
• Data-Driven Decision Making: Assists students and policymakers in making informed decisions based on detailed data.

The American University Degree Performance Dashboard project empowers users with a robust tool for analyzing degree outcomes across U.S. universities, facilitating better decision-making and planning.
